# Operation-Dreamworld

#{*0:00-0:28 Frank and I sitting in the room looking sad (During the part right after that when it says home but it starts to glitch like home home home that is the part it zooms into his head)

*0:29-0:49 All of us mining in the diamond tower gearing up enchanting etc.

0:50-0:52 Getting ready to fight

0:53-0:56 We start to charge in the fight

0:57-1:15 The fight goes on (we lose this fight)

1:16-1:21 We start argueing in the base in the area where the TV is 

1:22-1:35 Frank screams at this part then begins to give us a lecture, then towards the end of this part he walks away because we dont listen and then motions his hands like what ever

1:36-1:47 frank is at spawn with his gear about to jump out of the spawn to fight the people there

1:48-2:25 Frank is about to jump out of spawn to fight then I quickly grap his arm and stop him from jumping. He turns around and sees all of us with our gear ready to fight with him

2:26-2:35 We are about to jump and fight the people in front of spawn

2:36-2:42 we jump off the steps at spawn to fight the people but in the motion of jumping in the air we are in slo motion

2:43-3:09 The fight begins you make us fight the way you want us to

3:10-3:32-Shadow knocks franks sword out of his hand and frank falls on the floor and starts to back up and shadow is about to kill him then I shoot shadow then frank gets up grabs his sword and kills shadow

The rest of the animation is up to what you sink it up to 

All that is left is the camera zooms out of franks head and we are still sitting there then brandon and you tap on our shoulders and all 5 of us walk away and disappear}
